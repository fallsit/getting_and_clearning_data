##getting_and_cleaning_data project
=====================
Peer Assessment Project

The project includes the script "run_analysis.R" "README.md" "CodeBoo.md"

There are five steps describing how the script works:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

first of all I download and extract the data folder. finally, You can execute the run_analysis.R. It will output a text file named "tidydata.txt"

There are more explanation of code detail in the "run_analysis.R"
